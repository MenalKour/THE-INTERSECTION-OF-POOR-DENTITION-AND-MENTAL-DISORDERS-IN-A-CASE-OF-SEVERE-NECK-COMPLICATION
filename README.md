F: This case focuses on the occurrence of a deep odontogenic deep neck infection in a patient with a history of schizophrenia, the role of combined multidisciplinary care in the management of severe infections in psychiatric patients, and the diagnostic complexities that arise due to delayed presentation in such patients.
 C.P: 56 year old male P.V., was hospitalized in the ENT department of Lviv Regional Clinical Hospital with complaints of fever, swelling on the left side of his neck, and difficulty swallowing. Symptoms began approximately a week prior to admission and progressively worsened, with the patient refusing to eat and remaining uncommunicative. Long standing history of paranoid schizophrenia and patient was categorized as Group I disabled. History indicated that three days before hospitalization, the patient developed a painful, dense swelling in the left supraclavicular region, accompanied by redness and increased swelling in the neck. On admission, the patient appeared severely ill. The patient was afebrile during the examination but had SpO2 levels of 98%. CT of the neck revealed left sided retropharyngeal abscess extending into the anterior and posterior paravertebral spaces. Maxillofacial assessment indicated significant dental pathology. Multiple teeth showed deep caries, which served as the primary source of infection.
 DIS: The final diagnosis: “ Left sided neck phlegmon secondary to odontogenic infection. Cervical and supraclavicular lymphadenopathy.  Paranoid schizophrenia.” Treatment involved immediate surgical drainage of the abscess and phlegmon. Broad spectrum intravenous antibiotics were administered and in addition the maxillofacial surgery was performed to extract severely carious teeth and address the primary source of infection. 
C : Odontogenic cervical complications in the patient with concomitant paranoid schizophrenia were diagnosed late due to patient’s cognitive impairments and social isolation and neglect for personal hygiene and the treatment was prolonged at both inpatient and outpatient stages. Raising awareness among first contact physicians, and psychiatrists can reduce delays in diagnosis and treatment by multidisciplinary teams of specialists.
